Django F-Spot Browser
=============

This is a Python/Django F-Spot database browser.  It is inspired by the efforts of the seemingly defunct phpfspot [1]

The idea behind this project is for people who use F-Spot to be able to publish their entire database to the web.  It's not a replacement for F-Spot as it's read-only, although it may include some features for tagging photos or adding comments.
